Everything is clearly explained in the comments of the code but these are the main takeaways:
- You can use an arrow operator to quickly dereference a pointer and access its data
- Template classes are classes that handle parameters of a type that can be defined at compile time. This allows multiple class instantiation that can handle different types without having to write a new class for each new type.

- The implemented search function works as follows:
    - If the value of the current node is the desired value, return this node
    - If the desired value is larger than the desired value, move to the right node
        - If this node does not exist, the number is not in the tree
    - If the desired value is smaller than the desired value, move to the left node
        - If this node does not exist, the number is not in the tree

- The implemented tree print function works as follows:
    - If the right subnode is not a nullpointer, move to the right node
    - Print the current node's value
    - If the left subnode is not a nullpointer, move to the left node
