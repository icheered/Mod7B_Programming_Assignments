Inheritance

1. In order to reduce code redundancy as the different package types pretty much only differ in cost
2. protected can be accessed by classes who inherit the class. Public is accessible by everyone and private only by the class itself.
3. There can be conflictiing definitions in the multiple classes one inherits.
4. A computer is composed by different components as cpu, memory or mainboard. There are different types of Pc's as for example a
   gaming Pc which has everything a common Pc has and an additional graphics card. Thereby it can inherit everything from the PC ad just add the graphics card.
5. At the end of the scope which determines the objects lifetime. this assumes normal stack allocation otherwise it is called with the delete keyword.
6. When we use polymorphism and assign an inherited object to a base class memory leaks can occur. When we use a virtual destructor the object will definetely be removed.
   This behaviour is very similar to how virtual is used in functions aswell.
